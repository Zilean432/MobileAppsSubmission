# Mobile Applications Design and Development Submission

This application is designed with the theme being the UN Sustainability Goals, particularly goal number 7: Affordable and Clean Energy.

The application is designed to function as a companion app for solar panels, with the goal of displaying estimated power generation based on the weather forecast for a given day.

While not as well-developed as a professional/commercial product would be, the application in it's current state performs the following functions:

- Allows the user to navigate from the home page to either of the other two pages in the app.
- Allows the user to navigate back to the home page from any other page in the app.
- Allows the user to navigate from one page back to the page they were previously on.
- Allows the user to input information about their solar panels and the city they are in.
- Allow the user to save the information they have input about their solar panels and city so that it can be used elsewhere in the app.
- Connects to and retrieves data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays the necessary information from the API that is also used in the app's calculation code.
- Uses information obtained from the API to perform calculations together with the information previously entered into the app's local storage by the user.
- Displays the end results of it's calculations for the user to see on the screen.
